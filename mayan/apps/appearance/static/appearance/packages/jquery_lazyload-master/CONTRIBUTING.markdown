# Contributing to Lazy Load

## Only one feature or change per pull request

Make pull requests only one feature or change at the time. For example you have fixed a bug. You also have optimized some code. Optimization is not related to a bug. These should be submitted as separate pull requests. This way I can easily choose what to include. It is also easier to understand the code changes. Commit messages should be descriptive and full sentences.

Do not commit minified versions. Do not touch the version number. Make the pull requests against [1.9.x branch](https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload/commits/1.9.x).

## Follow the existing coding standards

When contributing to open source project it is polite to follow the original authors coding standars. They might be different than yours. It is not a holy war. Just follow then original.

```javascript
var snake_case = "something";

function camelCase(options) {
}

if (true !== false) {
    console.log("here be dragons");
}
```
